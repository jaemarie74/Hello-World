# Hello-World
This is my first repository
Hello my name is Janette Martin. This is my first asssignment for software 101.
A bit about me...I am positive by nature. I don't see my glass as half full or half empty. I am just happy I even have a glass.
I am optimistic, determined and motivated to achieve greatness. I believe that thoughts dictate the direction our lives. 
A favorite quote of mine is, " don't tell me te sky is the limit when there are footsteps on the moon."
